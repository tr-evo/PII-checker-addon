## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added

#### Core PII Detection & Masking
- **Multi-method PII Detection**: Comprehensive detection using regex patterns, ML-based Named Entity Recognition (NER), and deny-list matching
- **Supported PII Types**: Email addresses, phone numbers, credit cards, IBANs, BIC codes, names, addresses, postal codes, URLs, UUIDs, SSNs, tax IDs, and dates of birth
- **Confidence-based Detection**: Configurable confidence thresholds (0.5-1.0) for each PII type to balance accuracy vs false positives
- **On-device Processing**: All PII detection runs locally using transformers.js with Xenova/bert-base-NER model
- **WebWorker Support**: Heavy ML processing offloaded to web workers to prevent UI blocking

#### Smart Content Script Integration
- **Universal LLM Support**: Works with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI chat interfaces
- **Intelligent Form Detection**: Automatically detects text areas, input fields, and contenteditable elements
- **Send Button Management**: Temporarily disables send functionality during PII processing
- **Text Restoration**: Seamlessly replaces original text with masked version after processing
- **Real-time Preview**: Shows masked content before submission with user approval flow

#### Comprehensive Settings System
- **Security Presets**: Three built-in presets (Strict, Balanced, Loose) for different use cases
- **Custom Configuration**: Fine-tune each PII type individually with enable/disable toggles and confidence thresholds
- **Site Management**: Enable/disable protection per website with site-specific overrides
- **Performance Tuning**: Configurable processing timeouts with fallback actions (allow/block/prompt)
- **Chrome Storage Sync**: Settings synchronized across devices using chrome.storage.sync

#### Enterprise Management & Policies
- **Chrome Enterprise Integration**: Full support for chrome.storage.managed policies
- **Comprehensive Policy Schema**: 50+ configurable enterprise policy fields
- **Field-level Locking**: Granular control over which settings can be modified by users
