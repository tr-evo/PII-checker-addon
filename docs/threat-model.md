# Threat Model Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive threat model analysis for the PII Checker Chrome Extension. Using the STRIDE methodology, we identify potential security threats, assess their likelihood and impact, and document mitigation strategies.

## System Overview

### Architecture Components
1. **Content Script**: Injected into LLM web pages
2. **Background Service Worker**: Extension lifecycle management
3. **WebWorker**: Isolated ML processing environment
4. **Options UI**: User configuration interface
5. **Storage Layer**: Chrome storage APIs
6. **ML Pipeline**: On-device PII detection models

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Content Script → WebWorker → ML Processing → Masked Output → User Review → Final Submission
```

### Trust Boundaries
- **Browser/Extension Boundary**: Chrome API permissions
- **Extension/Website Boundary**: Content script isolation  
- **Main Thread/Worker Boundary**: WebWorker message passing
- **Local/Remote Boundary**: No remote data transmission
