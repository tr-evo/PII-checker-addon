# Monitoring & Audit Guide

This guide covers monitoring extension usage, ensuring compliance, and conducting security audits for the PII Checker Extension.

## Overview

The PII Checker Extension provides comprehensive logging and audit capabilities for enterprise environments. This includes usage tracking, policy compliance monitoring, and detailed audit trails for security and regulatory compliance.

## Audit Data Collection

### What Gets Logged

When audit logging is enabled (`compliance.auditMode: true`), the extension logs:

- **PII Detection Events**: Type, confidence, masked content length
- **Policy Enforcement**: Settings changes, policy violations, locked field access attempts
- **Usage Patterns**: Site usage, detection frequency, user behavior
- **System Events**: Extension loads, errors, policy updates

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: All logs stored locally in Chrome's IndexedDB
- **No External Transmission**: No data sent to external servers by default
- **Retention Management**: Automatic cleanup based on retention policies
- **Export Capabilities**: JSON/CSV export for external analysis (if not disabled)

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Deployment Metrics**
   - Extension installation rate across organization
   - Policy application success rate  
   - Version distribution and update compliance

2. **Usage Metrics**
   - Active users (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - PII detection frequency by type
   - Site usage patterns
   - User engagement with masking prompts

3. **Security Metrics**
   - Policy violation attempts
   - Bypassed or ignored PII warnings
   - Export/import activities
   - Configuration changes

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Processing times and timeouts
   - Error rates and failure modes
   - Resource usage impact

### Setting Up Monitoring

#### 1. Enable Comprehensive Logging

```json
{
  "compliance": {
    "auditMode": true,
    "mandatoryLogging": true
  },
  "features": {
    "loggingForced": true
  },
  "dataRetention": {
    "maxRetentionDays": 90,
    "forceRetention": true,
    "autoCleanup": true
  }
}
```

#### 2. Configure Log Aggregation

For centralized monitoring, users can export logs for aggregation:

```javascript
// Example log export automation (user script)
async function exportLogs() {
  const response = await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
    type: 'EXPORT_LOGS',
    format: 'json'
  });
  
  // Send to central logging system
  await fetch('https://logging.company.com/pii-checker', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(response.data)
  });
}
```

## Compliance Monitoring

### Regulatory Requirements

#### GDPR Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only log necessary metadata
- **User Consent**: Inform users about logging (enterprise deployment implies consent)
- **Data Retention**: Respect maximum retention periods
- **Right to Delete**: Provide log clearing mechanisms

#### SOX Compliance
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of all financial data interactions
- **Access Controls**: Monitor who can modify extension settings
- **Change Management**: Log all configuration changes with timestamps

#### HIPAA Compliance
- **PHI Protection**: Ensure no actual PII is logged, only metadata
- **Access Logging**: Track all access to logs and settings
- **Integrity**: Maintain tamper-evident log records

### Compliance Reporting

#### Weekly Compliance Report

    }
  ]
}
```

#### Monthly Audit Summary

- Deployment status across organizational units
- Policy compliance rates
- Security incident summary
- Performance and reliability metrics
- Recommendations for policy adjustments

## Security Monitoring

### Threat Detection

Monitor for these potential security issues:

1. **Policy Bypass Attempts**
   - Users trying to disable locked settings
   - Attempts to export data when prohibited
   - Modification of extension files

2. **Unusual Usage Patterns**
   - Excessive PII detection on single user
   - Attempts to use prohibited sites
   - High frequency of ignored warnings

3. **Data Exfiltration Risks**
   - Unusual export activities
   - Large volume log exports
   - Access from unusual locations/devices

### Alert Configuration

#### High Priority Alerts

```json
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "name": "policy_violation_spike",
      "condition": "policy_violations > 10 per user per day",
      "severity": "high",
      "action": "email_security_team"
    },
    {
      "name": "data_export_attempt",
      "condition": "export_disabled == true AND export_attempted == true",
      "severity": "critical",
      "action": "immediate_notification"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Incident Response

#### Detection and Response Workflow

1. **Automated Detection**: Log analysis identifies potential incidents
2. **Alert Generation**: Security team receives immediate notification
3. **Investigation**: Review logs and user activity patterns
4. **Response Actions**: Block access, reset policies, user education
5. **Documentation**: Record incident and lessons learned

#### Response Playbooks

**Data Export Violation**
1. Identify user and timestamp
2. Review what data was attempted to be exported
3. Check if export was actually completed
4. Interview user to understand intent
5. Implement additional controls if needed

**Policy Bypass Attempt**  
1. Document the bypass method attempted
2. Verify policy is correctly applied
3. Check for browser/extension version issues
4. Update policies to close loophole if needed
5. Provide user training on proper usage

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Processing Time | < 2 seconds | > 5 seconds |
| Detection Accuracy | > 95% | < 90% |
| False Positive Rate | < 5% | > 10% |
| User Acceptance Rate | > 90% | < 80% |

### Performance Optimization

#### Monitoring Processing Times

```javascript
// Log performance metrics
const startTime = performance.now();
await piiDetector.detectPII(text, options);
const processingTime = performance.now() - startTime;

logger.log({
  type: 'performance',
  processingTime,
  textLength: text.length,
  detectionsFound: results.length
});
```

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust confidence thresholds based on false positive rates
2. **Site-Specific Optimization**: Different settings for different platforms
3. **Batch Processing**: Optimize for common text patterns
4. **Cache Strategies**: Cache detection results for similar text

```javascript
// Enterprise monitoring integration
class EnterpriseMonitoring {
  async collectMetrics() {
    const logs = await piiLogger.getLogs({
      startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000),
      format: 'json'
    });
    
    return this.processLogs(logs);
  }
  
  async sendToSIEM(data) {
    await fetch('https://siem.company.com/api/ingest', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + this.apiKey,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
  }
}
```
